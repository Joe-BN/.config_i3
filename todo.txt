Things I need to do on this syste:
- solve audio issues (less but still has roughness in the audio)
- wallpaper and image viewer + screen shots (feh ?)
- file manager (GUI and TUI managers) (Thunar + ...?)


- look into flakes and home-manager
	I have seen a bit about home-manager, it might serve it's perpose, but:
	it would also be nice to see sth that give me editing permissions (doesn't lock dotfile to read only)
	maybe sth like Ganu Stow !? (so that I can control all my files and still manage them)
	{I'll see as I go along; could always disable it}



- notifications and popups ?
- systemwide nerdfont ?
- TUI file manager
- configure Neovim
Shell:
  - configure bash 'header'; 
    - git indicators
    -short location part
    - color
    ...
  - consider zsh ?


# using flakes:
- devolopment shells:
  isolation of development environments
  {How to use flakes to configure development shells and store them on github}

- Nix language for development



- Manage secrets (eg: ssh keys and passwords)
