Things I need to do on this syste:
- solve audio issues
- wallpaper and image viewer + screen shots
- file manager (GUI and TUI managers)

- picom:
	rounding
	slight transparency
	~ gaps
	...

- docker containers
- configure git

smaller:
- the blue color as the top of stacked windows (gray like title bar/ a bit darker)
- the blue line where the next window opens (different shade of grey)



- look into flakes and home-manager
	I have seen a bit about home-manager, it might serve it's perpose, but:
	it would also be nice to see sth that give me editing permissions (doesn't lock dotfile to read only)
	maybe sth like Ganu Stow !? (so that I can control all my files and still manage them)
	{I'll see as I go along; could always disable it}

- dev environements ? + nix for devs




- how to manage ssh keys and all that with nixos
